# Learning Python

This repository contains my Python practice scripts and exercises as I build a foundation in data analysis and machine learning.

### Topics I'm currently learning
- Python basics (variables, functions, loops)
- Control flow & data structures
- Dictionaries, lists, list comprehensions
- Pandas & Matplotlib (foundations)
- Simple data cleaning and simulations

### Goal
Develop practical Python skills through continuous practice and small learning projects.
